# ThePerfectGuess
The Perfect Guess:-
A simple Python-based number guessing game where you try to guess a randomly chosen number between 1 and 100.

How It Works:-
The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.

You keep guessing until you get the correct number.

After each guess, you'll be told if the actual number is higher or lower.

At the end, the program tells you how many attempts it took to guess the number correctly.

Example:-
Guess the number: 50  
Higher number Please  
Guess the number: 75  
Lower number please  
Guess the number: 65  
You have guessed the number 65 correctly in 3 attempts
